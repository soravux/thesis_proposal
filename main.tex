\chapter{Schedule}

%The problems will be explored in increasing order of complexity according to the following schedule. First, the hardware required to gather the sky illumination database will be setup on a tall roof nearby, and the data acquisition process will be continued over a period of several months to build a rich dataset. Second, experiments with existing PS techniques to reconstruct shape with known illumination will be conducted. Leaning on these experiments, the algorithms will then be adapted to require knowledge only of the sun direction, obtained from the capture timestamps. Finally we will experiment with images where the lighting conditions are unknown.

The proposed schedule is presented in the Gantt chart in fig.~\ref{fig:schedule-gantt}. This per-session estimate plans the realization of all the proposed work before 2018, and I plan to defend my thesis by the end of the winter session of 2018.

The two first conference paper planned are the calibrated and uncalibrated algorithms, each respectively are to be submitted at WACV on June 25th, 2016, and ICCV on April 22th, 2016. Then, a paper using the moon in conjunction with the sun is planned at ICCP on December 9th 2017. Pertinent conferences for all three papers include WACV, ICCP, 3DV and CVPR.

A journal paper extending the analysis performed in the previous contributions over more datasets is planned to be submitted at the end of 2016. At the beginning of 2018, wrapping and extending the calibrated and uncalibrated planned contributions to new datasets is forecast. The IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) and the Machine Vision and Applications (MVA) journals are the targets for those contributions.

\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

% Clear that the community has an interest
\todo{Why do I think I can do it?}
From the generally positive reviews and comments we received for our previous work, it seems clear to me that the community is interested in outdoors PS. Continuing the work already begun toward the proposed contributions will bring a new level of understanding of the impact of natural illumination on PS. This will enable the development of practical outdoor PS algorithms, extending the capabilities of cheap and common cameras to 3D scanning.

The need in 3D scanning is greatly increasing these last few years. This is especially true for outdoor objects, where architectural monuments are needed for use in video games, preservation of cultural heritage, special effects in the movie industry and many more. Bringing PS to the outdoor light will empower the masses to perform this world digitization. As such, I firmly believe that the proposed contributions will have a remarkable impact on 3D shape scanning altogether.
