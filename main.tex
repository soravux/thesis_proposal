\chapter{Schedule}

%The problems will be explored in increasing order of complexity according to the following schedule. First, the hardware required to gather the sky illumination database will be setup on a tall roof nearby, and the data acquisition process will be continued over a period of several months to build a rich dataset. Second, experiments with existing PS techniques to reconstruct shape with known illumination will be conducted. Leaning on these experiments, the algorithms will then be adapted to require knowledge only of the sun direction, obtained from the capture timestamps. Finally we will experiment with images where the lighting conditions are unknown.

The proposed schedule is presented in the Gantt chart in fig.~\ref{fig:schedule-gantt}. This per-session estimate plans the realization of all the proposed work before 2018. In addition to this schedule, I plan to submit at least three conference papers and two journal papers.

The two first conference paper planned are the calibrated and uncalibrated algorithm, each respectively are to be submitted during 2016 and 2017. Then, at the end of 2017, a paper using the moon in conjunction with the sun is planned. Pertinent conferences for all three papers include WACV, ICCP, 3DV and CVPR.

A journal paper extending the analysis performed in the previous contributions over more datasets is planned during 2016. At the beginning of 2018, wrapping and extending the calibrated and uncalibrated planned contributions to new datasets is forecast. The PAMI journal is the target for those contributions.

\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

% Clear that the community has an interest
From the generally positive reviews and comments we received for our previous work, it seems clear to me that the community is interested in outdoors PS.

\todo{Why do I think _I_ can do it?}
