\section{Permutations of pair of images}
\label{anx:permutations}

From a set of $n$ images, the quantity of possible pairs of images is expressed as a special case of the permutation without repetition:
\begin{equation}
\frac{n!}{\left( n - 2 \right)!} \quad.
\end{equation}

By the definition of the factorial, this equation can be simplified to
\begin{equation}
\frac{n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times (n-3) \times \cdots \times 2}{(n-2) \times (n-3) \times \cdots \times 2} \quad.
\end{equation}

By simplifying, we find that the quantity is exactly
\begin{equation}
n^2 - n\quad,
\end{equation}
giving a quadratic expression (also called $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in Bachmann-Landau notation).
