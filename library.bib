abstract = {We present a system that can match and reconstruct 3D scenes from extremely large collections of photographs such as those found by searching for a given city (e.g., Rome) on Internet photo sharing sites. Our system uses a collection of novel parallel distributed matching and reconstruction algorithms, designed to maximize parallelism at each stage in the pipeline and minimize serialization bottlenecks. It is designed to scale gracefully with both the size of the problem and the amount of available computation. We have experi- mented with a variety of alternative algorithms at each stage of the pipeline and report on which ones work best in a parallel computing environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that it is now possible to reconstruct cities con- sisting of 150K images in less than a day on a cluster with 500 compute cores.},

@article{Bresson2008,
abstract = {We propose a regularization algorithm for color/vectorial images which is fast, easy to code and mathematically well-posed. More precisely, the regulariza- tion model is based on the dual formulation of the vectorial Total Variation (VTV) norm and it may be regarded as the vectorial extension of the dual approach de- fined by Chambolle in [13] for gray-scale/scalar images. The proposed model offers several advantages. First, it minimizes the exact VTV norm whereas standard approaches use a regularized norm. Then, the numerical scheme of minimization is straightforward to implement and finally, the number of iterations to reach the solution is low, which gives a fast regularization algorithm. Finally, and maybe more importantly, the proposed VTV minimization scheme can be easily extended to many standard applications. We apply this L1 vectorial regularization algo- rithm to the following problems: color inverse scale space, color denoising with the chromaticity-brightness color representation, color image inpainting, color wavelet shrinkage, color image decomposition, color image deblurring, and color denoising on manifolds. Generally speaking, this VTV minimization scheme can be used in problems that required vector field (color, other feature vector) regularization while preserving discontinuities.},

abstract = {Given a multi-exposure sequence of a scene, our aim is to recover the absolute irradiance falling onto a linear camera sensor. The established approach is to perform a weighted average of the scaled input exposures. However, there is no clear consensus on the appropriate weighting to use. We propose a weighting function that produces statistically optimal estimates under the assumption of compound-Gaussian noise. Our weighting is based on a calibrated camera model that accounts for all noise sources. This model also allows us to simultaneously estimate the irradiance and its uncertainty. We evaluate our method on simulated and real world photographs, and show that we consistently improve the signal-to-noise ratio over previous approaches. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our model for optimal exposure sequence selection and HDR image denoising.},

@article{Arora2002,
abstract = {In the past two decades, numerous scheduling and load balancing techniques have been proposed for locally distributed multiprocessor systems. However they all suffer from significant deficiencies when extended to a Grid environment: some use a centralized approach that renders the algorithm unscalable, while others assume the overhead involved in searching for appropriate resources to be negligible. Furthermore, classical scheduling algorithms do not consider a Grid node to be N-resource rich and merely work towards maximizing the utilization of one of the resources. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling and load balancing algorithm for a generalized Grid model of N-resource nodes that not only takes into account the node and network heterogeneity, but also considers the overhead involved in coordinating among the nodes. Our algorithm is decentralized, scalable, and overlaps the node coordination time with that of the actual processing of ready jobs, thus saving valuable clock cycles needed for making decisions. The proposed algorithm is studied by conducting simulations using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) paradigm.},

abstract = {In previous research (Tech. Rep. 172, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, Calif., 1991) we developed an iterative shape-from-shading (SFS) algorithm that uses a single image, by combining a triangular-element surface model with a linearized reflectance map. In the current research we generalize the single-image SFS algorithm to the photometric stereo SFS algorithm, which uses multiple images taken under different lighting conditions for more-accurate surface reconstruction. An explicit surface model based on nodal basis-function representation is used so that the integrability problem that arises in conventional photometric stereo SFS algorithms can be solved easily. It is also shown that single-image SFS algorithms have an inherent problem; i.e., the accuracy of the reconstructed surface height is related to the slope of the reflectance-map function defined on the gradient space. The accuracy can be greatly improved by combining two photometric images properly, and the optimal illumination condition that leads to the best shape reconstruction is examined. Simulation results for several test images are given to demonstrate the performance of our new algorithm},

Our optimization-based method builds on the observation that most objects are composed of a small number of fundamental materials by constraining each pixel to be representable by a combination of at most two such materials. This approach recovers not only the shape but also material BRDFs and weight maps, yielding accurate rerenderings under novel lighting conditions for a wide variety of objects. We demonstrate examples of interactive editing operations made possible by our approach.},

abstract = {We introduce an iterative algorithm for shape reconstruction from multiple images of a moving (Lambertian) object illuminated by distant (and possibly time varying) lighting. Starting with an initial piecewise linear surface, the algorithm iteratively estimates a new surface based on the previous surface estimate and the photometric information available from the input image sequence. During each iteration, standard photometric stereo techniques are applied to estimate the surface normals up to an unknown generalized bas-relief transform, and a new surface is computed by integrating the estimated normals. The algorithm essentially consists of a sequence of matrix factorizations (of intensity values) followed by minimization using gradient descent (integration of the normals). Conceptually, the algorithm admits a clear geometric interpretation, which is used to provide a qualitative analysis of the algorithm's convergence. Implementation-wise, it is straightforward being based on several established photometric stereo and structure from motion algorithms. We demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness of our algorithm using several videos of hand-held objects moving in front of a fixed light and camera},

@article{Langer1994,
abstract = {In the classical shape-from-shading model, surface luminance depends primarily on the unit surface normal. However, under diffuse lighting conditions, such as the sky on a cloudy day, luminance depends primarily on the amount of sky that is visible from each surface element, with surface normal of secondary importance. This claim is formalized in terms of a dominating sky principle and a surface aperture function. An approximately functional constraint between surface luminance and aperture emerges. It is shown how to use this constraint to recover a depth map from an image efficiently. A curious difference from the classical shape-from-shading problem is uncovered. When one assumes a point light source, the local geometric constraints of the shape-from-shading problem lie along the surface. However, in the diffuse-lighting problem, the local geometric constraints are found in a visibility field, which is defined in the free space above the surface.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship between incoming radiance and irradiance. Specifically, we address the question of whether it is possible to compute the incident radiance from knowledge of the irradiance at all surface orientations. This is a fundamental question in computer vision and inverse radiative transfer. We show that the irradiance can be viewed as a simple convolution of the incident illumination, i.e., radiance and a clamped cosine transfer function. Estimating the radiance can then be seen as a deconvolution operation. We derive a simple closed-form formula for the irradiance in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients of the incident illumination and demonstrate that the odd-order modes of the lighting with order greater than 1 are completely annihilated. Therefore these components cannot be estimated from the irradiance, contradicting a theorem that is due to Preisendorfer. A practical realization of the radiance-from-irradiance problem is the estimation of the lighting from images of a homogeneous convex curved Lambertian surface of known geometry under distant illumination, since a Lambertian object reflects light equally in all directions proportional to the irradiance. We briefly discuss practical and physical considerations and describe a simple experimental test to verify our theoretical results.},

abstract = {A set of images of a Lambertian surface under varying lighting directions defines its shape up to a three-parameter generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity. In this paper, we examine this ambiguity in the context of surfaces having an additive non-Lambertian reflectance component, and we show that the GBR ambiguity is resolved by any non-Lambertian reflectance function that is isotropic and spatially invariant. The key observation is that each point on a curved surface under directional illumination is a member of a family of points that are in isotropic or reciprocal configurations. We show that the GBR can be resolved in closed form by identifying members of these families in two or more images. Based on this idea, we present an algorithm for recovering full Euclidean geometry from a set of uncalibrated photometric stereo images, and we evaluate it empirically on a number of examples.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in computer vision is that of inferring the intrinsic, 3D structure of the world from flat, 2D images of that world. Traditional methods for recovering scene properties such as shape, reflectance, or illumination rely on multiple observations of the same scene to overconstrain the problem. Recovering these same properties from a single image seems almost impossible in comparison there are an infinite number of shapes, paint, and lights that exactly reproduce a single image. However, certain explanations are more likely than others: surfaces tend to be smooth, paint tends to be uniform, and illumination tends to be natural. We therefore pose this problem as one of statistical inference, and define an optimization problem that searches for the most likely explanation of a single image. Our technique can be viewed as a superset of several classic computer vision problems (shape-from-shading, intrinsic images, color constancy, illumination estimation, etc) and outperforms all previous solutions to those constituent problems.},

Here we concentrate on objects with specularly reflecting surfaces, since these are of importance in industrial applications. Previous methods, intended for diffusely reflecting surfaces, employed point source illumination, which is quite unsuitable in this case. Instead, we use a distributed light source obtained by uneven illumination of a diffusely reflecting planar surface. Experimental results are shown to verify analytic expressions obtained for a method employing three light source distributions.},

abstract = {Many tasks in computer vision involve assigning a label (such as disparity) to every pixel. A common constraint is that the labels should vary smoothly almost everywhere while preserving sharp discontinuities that may exist, e.g., at object boundaries. These tasks are naturally stated in terms of energy minimization. The authors consider a wide class of energies with various smoothness constraints. Global minimization of these energy functions is NP-hard even in the simplest discontinuity-preserving case. Therefore, our focus is on efficient approximation algorithms. We present two algorithms based on graph cuts that efficiently find a local minimum with respect to two types of large moves, namely expansion moves and swap moves. These moves can simultaneously change the labels of arbitrarily large sets of pixels. In contrast, many standard algorithms (including simulated annealing) use small moves where only one pixel changes its label at a time. Our expansion algorithm finds a labeling within a known factor of the global minimum, while our swap algorithm handles more general energy functions. Both of these algorithms allow important cases of discontinuity preserving energies. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for image restoration, stereo and motion. On real data with ground truth, we achieve 98 percent accuracy},

abstract = {Light occlusions are one of the most significant difficulties of photometric stereo methods. When three or more images are available without occlusion, the local surface orientation is overdetermined so that shape can be computed and the shadowed pixels can be discarded. In this paper, we look at the challenging case when only two images are available without occlusion, leading to a one degree of freedom ambiguity per pixel in the local orientation. We show that, in the presence of noise, integrability alone cannot resolve this ambiguity and reconstruct the geometry in the shadowed regions. As the problem is ill-posed in the presence of noise, we describe two regularization schemes that improve the numerical performance of the algorithm while preserving the data. Finally, the paper describes how this theory applies in the framework of color photometric stereo where one is restricted to only three images and light occlusions are common. Experiments on synthetic and real image sequences are presented.},

abstract = {Minimum cut/maximum flow algorithms on graphs have emerged as an increasingly useful tool for exactor approximate energy minimization in low-level vision. The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push -relabel" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths." We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes.},

@article{Cossairt2008,
abstract = {We present a novel image-based method for compositing real and synthetic objects in the same scene with a high degree of visual realism. Ours is the first technique to allow global illumination and near-field lighting effects between both real and synthetic objects at interactive rates, without needing a geometric and material model of the real scene. We achieve this by using a light field interface between real and synthetic components---thus, indirect illumination can be simulated using only two 4D light fields, one captured from and one projected onto the real scene. Multiple bounces of interreflections are obtained simply by iterating this approach. The interactivity of our technique enables its use with time-varying scenes, including dynamic objects. This is in sharp contrast to the alternative approach of using 6D or 8D light transport functions of real objects, which are very expensive in terms of acquisition and storage and hence not suitable for real-time applications. In our method, 4D radiance fields are simultaneously captured and projected by using a lens array, video camera, and digital projector. The method supports full global illumination with restricted object placement, and accommodates moderately specular materials. We implement a complete system and show several example scene compositions that demonstrate global illumination effects between dynamic real and synthetic objects. Our implementation requires a single point light source and dark background.},

@article{Gong2012,
abstract = {In real-world applications of visual recognition, many factorssuch as pose, illumination, or image qualitycan cause a significant mismatch between the source domain on which classifiers are trained and the target domain to which those classifiers are applied. As such, the classifiers often perform poorly on the target domain. Domain adap- tation techniques aim to correct the mismatch. Existing ap- proaches have concentrated on learning feature represen- tations that are invariant across domains, and they often do not directly exploit low-dimensional structures that are in- trinsic to many vision datasets. In this paper, we propose a new kernel-based method that takes advantage of such structures. Our geodesic flow kernel models domain shift by integrating an infinite number of subspaces that charac- terize changes in geometric and statistical properties from the source to the target domain. Our approach is compu- tationally advantageous, automatically inferring important algorithmic parameters without requiring extensive cross- validation or labeled data from either domain. We also introduce a metric that reliably measures the adaptability between a pair of source and target domains. For a given target domain and several source domains, the metric can be used to automatically select the optimal source domain to adapt and avoid less desirable ones. Empirical studies on standard datasets demonstrate the advantages of our ap- proach over competing methods.},

@article{Kolmogorov2004a,
abstract = {In the last few years, several new algorithms based on graph cuts have been developed to solve energy minimization problems in computer vision. Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available.},

interactive segmentation of N-dimensional images. The user marks certain

incorporate both boundary and region information. Graph cuts are used to
find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The

abstract = {We consider the problem of detecting robotic grasps in an RGB-D view of a scene containing objects. In this work, we apply a deep learning approach to solve this problem, which avoids time-consuming hand-design of features. This presents two main challenges. First, we need to evaluate a huge number of candidate grasps. In order to make detection fast, as well as robust, we present a two-step cascaded structure with two deep networks, where the top detections from the first are re-evaluated by the second. The first network has fewer features, is faster to run, and can effectively prune out unlikely candidate grasps. The second, with more features, is slower but has to run only on the top few detections. Second, we need to handle multimodal inputs well, for which we present a method to apply structured regularization on the weights based on multimodal group regularization. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in robotic grasp detection, and can be used to successfully execute grasps on two different robotic platforms.},

abstract = {A reformulated radiosity algorithm is presented that produces initial images in time linear to the number of patches. The enormous memory costs of the radiosity algorithm are also eliminated by computing form-factors on-the-fly. The technique is based on the approach of rendering by progressive refinement. The algorithm provides a useful solution almost immediately which progresses gracefully and continuously to the complete radiosity solution. In this way the competing demands of realism and interactivity are accommodated. The technique brings the use of radiosity for interactive rendering within reach and has implications for the use and development of current and future graphics workstations.},

abstract = {Spherical Harmonic lighting (SH lighting) is a technique for calculating the lighting on 3D models from area light sources that allows us to capture, relight and display global illumination style images in real time. It was introduced in a paper at Siggraph 2002 by Sloan, Kautz and Snyder as a technique for ultra realistic lighting of models. Looking a little closer at it’s derivation we can show that it is in fact a toolbox of interrelated techniques that the games community can use to good effect. The results are compelling and the code to compute them is actually straightforward to write, but the paper that introduces it assumes a lot of background knowledge from the first time reader. This paper is an attempt to provide this background, add some insights into the “why” questions, and hopefully give you all you need to add SH lighting to your game.},

@article{Ren2013,
abstract = {We present radiance regression functions for fast rendering of global illumination in scenes with dynamic local light sources. A radiance regression function (RRF) represents a non-linear map- ping from local and contextual attributes of surface points, such as position, viewing direction, and lighting condition, to their indirect illumination values. The RRF is obtained from precomputed shad- ing samples through regression analysis, which determines a func- tion that best fits the shading data. For a given scene, the shading samples are precomputed by an offline renderer. The key idea behind our approach is to exploit the nonlinear co- herence of the indirect illumination data to make the RRF both compact and fast to evaluate. We model the RRF as a multilayer acyclic feed-forward neural network, which provides a close func- tional approximation of the indirect illumination and can be effi- ciently evaluated at run time. To effectively model scenes with spa- tially variant material properties, we utilize an augmented set of attributes as input to the neural network RRF to reduce the amount of inference that the network needs to perform. To handle scenes with greater geometric complexity, we partition the input space of the RRF model and represent the subspaces with separate, smaller RRFs that can be evaluated more rapidly. As a result, the RRF model scales well to increasingly complex scene geometry and ma- terial variation. Because of its compactness and ease of evaluation, the RRF model enables real-time rendering with full global illu- mination effects, including changing caustics and multiple-bounce high-frequency glossy interreflections},

abstract = {In this paper we present a method for recovering the reflectance properties of all surfaces in a real scene from a sparse set of pho- tographs, taking into account both direct and indirect illumination. The result is a lighting-independent model of the scene’s geom- etry and reflectance properties, which can be rendered with ar- bitrary modifications to structure and lighting via traditional ren- dering methods. Our technique models reflectance with a low- parameter reflectance model, and allows diffuse albedo to vary arbi- trarily over surfaces while assuming that non-diffuse characteristics remain constant across particular regions. The method’s input is a geometric model of the scene and a set of calibrated high dynamic range photographs taken with known direct illumination. The al- gorithm hierarchically partitions the scene into a polygonal mesh, and uses image-based rendering to construct estimates of both the radiance and irradiance of each patch from the photographic data. The algorithm computes the expected location of specular high- lights, and then analyzes the highlight areas in the images by run- ning a novel iterative optimization procedure to recover the diffuse and specular reflectance parameters for each region. Lastly, these parameters are used in constructing high-resolution diffuse albedo maps for each surface. The algorithm has been applied to both real and synthetic data, including a synthetic cubical room and a real meeting room. Re- renderings are produced using a global illumination system under both original and novel lighting, and with the addition of synthetic objects. Side-by-side comparisons show success at predicting the appearance of the scene under novel lighting conditions.},

In essence, each object in the environment is treated as a secondary light source. The method provides an accurate representation of the "diffuse" and "ambient" terms found in typical image synthesis algorithms. The phenomena of "color bleeding" from one surface to another, shading within shadow envelopes, and penumbras along shadow boundaries are accurately reproduced. Additional advantages result because computations are independent of viewer position. This a11ows the efficient rendering of multiple views of the same scene for dynamic sequences. Light sources can be modulated and object reflectivities can be changed, with minimal extra computation. The procedures extend the radiosity method beyond the bounds previously imposed},

abstract = {Lambert's model for diffuse reflection is extensively used in computational vision. It is used explicitly by methods such as shape from shading and photometric stereo, and implicitly by methods such as binocular stereo and motion detection. For several real-world objects, the Lambertian model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the diffuse component. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent of viewing direction, the brightness of a rough diffuse surface increases as the viewer approaches the source direction. A comprehensive model is developed that predicts reflectance from rough diffuse surfaces. The model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between points on the surface. Experiments have been conducted on real samples, such as, plaster, clay, sand, and cloth. All these surfaces demonstrate significant deviation from Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements obtained are in strong agreement with the reflectance predicted by the proposed model. The paper is concluded with a discussion on the implications of these results for machine vision.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of obtaining complete, detailed reconstructions of textureless shiny objects. We present an algorithm which uses silhouettes of the object, as well as images obtained under changing illumination conditions. In contrast with previous photometric stereo techniques, ours is not limited to a single viewpoint but produces accurate reconstructions in full 3D. A number of images of the object are obtained from multiple viewpoints, under varying lighting conditions. Starting from the silhouettes, the algorithm recovers camera motion and constructs the object's visual hull. This is then used to recover the illumination and initialise a multi-view photometric stereo scheme to obtain a closed surface reconstruction. There are two main contributions in this paper: Firstly we describe a robust technique to estimate light directions and intensities and secondly, we introduce a novel formulation of photometric stereo which combines multiple viewpoints and hence allows closed surface reconstructions. The algorithm has been implemented as a practical model acquisition system. Here, a quantitative evaluation of the algorithm on synthetic data is presented together with complete reconstructions of challenging real objects. Finally, we show experimentally how even in the case of highly textured objects, this technique can greatly improve on correspondence-based multi-view stereo results.},

abstract = {The appearance of an outdoor scene depends on a variety of factors such as viewing geometry, scene structure and reflectance (BRDF or BTF), illumination (sun, moon, stars, street lamps), atmospheric condition (clear air, fog, rain) and weathering (or aging) of materials. Over time, these factors change, altering the way a scene appears. A large set of images is required to study the entire variability in scene appearance. In this paper, we present a database of high quality registered and calibrated images of a fixed outdoor scene captured every hour for over 5 months. The dataset covers a wide range of daylight and night illumination conditions, weather conditions and seasons. We describe in detail the image acquisition and sensor calibration procedures. The images are tagged with a variety of ground truth data such as weather and illumination conditions and actual scene depths. This database has potential implications for vision, graphics, image processing and atmospheric sciences and can be a testbed for many algorithms. We describe an example application - image analysis in bad weather - and show how this method can be evaluated using the images in the database. The database is available online at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/. The data collection is ongoing and we plan to acquire images for one year.},

abstract = {Threshold values of photoperiodic time-measurements correspond approximately to moonlight intensities. Experiments with Glycine and Euglena reveal that this is also the threshold value for synchronization of the circadian cycle. Saturation of this reaction is reached with 10 lx in 12:12 hr light-dark cycles. Thus, moonlight might disturb time measurement.In Glycine, Arachis, and Trifolium the intensity of the light coming from the moon to the upper surface of the leaf is reduced by circadian leaf movement to values between 5 and 20 per cent (or even less than 5 per cent) of full-moon light intensity. Such a reduction eliminates the disturbing effects of moonlight. This finding indicates that leaf movements have an adaptive value of the kind that Darwin sought to identify. It also indicates that the behavior of the upper leaf epidermis as a "sense organ for light"(13) has an adaptive value.In the short-day plants Perilla ocymoides and Chenopodium amaranticolor, a specific photoperiodic phenomenon was found that counteracts the disturbing effect of moonlight. Here light intensities similar to those of moonlight, introduced during the night, promote flowering instead of inhibiting it.},

@article{Kautz2002,
abstract = {Real-time shading using general (e.g., anisotropic) BRDFs has so far been limited to a few point or directional light sources. We extend such shading to smooth, area lighting using a low-order spherical harmonic basis for the lighting environment. We represent the 4D product function of BRDF times the cosine factor (dot product of the incident lighting and surface normal vectors) as a 2D table of spherical harmonic coefficients. Each table entry represents, for a single view direction, the integral of this product function times lighting on the hemisphere expressed in spherical harmonics. This reduces the shading integral to a simple dot product of 25 component vectors, easily evaluatable on PC graphics hardware. Non-trivial BRDF models require rotating the lighting coefficients to a local frame at each point on an object, currently forming the computational bottleneck. Real-time results can be achieved by fixing the view to allow dynamic lighting or vice versa. We also generalize a previous method for precomputed radiance transfer to handle general BRDF shading. This provides shadows and interreflections that respond in real-time to lighting changes on a preprocessed object of arbitrary material (BRDF) type.},

abstract = {Shadow maps are a widely used shadowing technique in real time graphics. One major drawback of their use is that they cannot be filtered in the same way as color textures, typically leading to severe aliasing. This paper introduces variance shadow maps, a new real time shadowing algorithm. Instead of storing a single depth value, we store the mean and mean squared of a distribution of depths, from which we can efficiently compute the variance over any filter region. Using the variance, we derive an upper bound on the fraction of a shaded fragment that is occluded. We show that this bound often provides a good approximation to the true occlusion, and can be used as an approximate value for rendering. Our algorithm is simple to implement on current graphics processors and solves the problem of shadow map aliasing with minimal additional storage and computation.},

abstract = {This paper details an empirical study of large image sets taken by static cameras. These images have consistent correlations over the entire image and over time scales of days to months. Simple second-order statistics of such image sets show vastly more structure than exists in generic natural images or video from moving cameras. Using a slight variant to PCA, we can decompose all cameras into comparable components and annotate images with respect to surface orientation, weather, and seasonal change. Experiments are based on a data set from 538 cameras across the United States which have collected more than 17 million images over the the last 6 months.},

abstract = {We present a new, real-time method for rendering diffuse and glossy objects in low-frequency lighting environments that cap- tures soft shadows, interreflections, and caustics. As a preprocess, a novel global transport simulator creates functions over the object’s surface representing transfer of arbitrary, low-frequency incident lighting into transferred radiance which includes global effects like shadows and interreflections from the object onto itself. At run-time, these transfer functions are applied to actual incident lighting. Dynamic, local lighting is handled by sampling it close to the object every frame; the object can also be rigidly rotated with respect to the lighting and vice versa. Lighting and Figure 1: Precomputed, unshadowed irradiance from [34] (left) vs. our transfer functions are represented using low-order spherical precomputed transfer (right). The right model can be rendered at 129Hz harmonics. This avoids aliasing and evaluates efficiently on with self-shadowing and self-interreflection in any lighting environment. graphics hardware by reducing the shading integral to a dot product of 9 to 25 element vectors for diffuse receivers. Glossy frequency lighting environments, using a low-order spherical objects are handled using matrices rather than vectors. We further harmonic (SH) basis to represent such environments efficiently introduce functions for radiance transfer from a dynamic lighting without aliasing. The main idea is to represent how an object environment through a preprocessed object to neighboring points scatters this light onto itself or its neighboring space. in space. These allow soft shadows and caustics from rigidly To describe our technique, assume initially we have a convex, moving objects to be cast onto arbitrary, dynamic receivers. We diffuse object lit by an infinitely distant environment map. The demonstrate real-time global lighting effects with this approach.},

In this study, we describe a trainable computer vision system enabling the automated analysis of complex mouse behaviours. We provide software and an extensive manually annotated video database used for training and testing the system. Our system performs on par with human scoring, as measured from ground-truth manual annotations of thousands of clips of freely behaving mice. As a validation of the system, we characterized the home-cage behaviours of two standard inbred and two non-standard mouse strains. From these data, we were able to predict in a blind test the strain identity of individual animals with high accuracy. Our video-based software will complement existing sensor-based automated approaches and enable an adaptable, comprehensive, high-throughput, fine-grained, automated analysis of mouse behaviour.},

abstract = {Visual perception is a challenging problem in part due to illumination variations. A possible solution is to first estimate an illumination invariant representation before using it for recognition. The object albedo and surface normals are examples of such representations. In this paper, we introduce a multilayer generative model where the latent variables include the albedo, surface normals, and the light source. Combining Deep Belief Nets with the Lambertian reflectance assumption, our model can learn good priors over the albedo from 2D images. Illumination variations can be explained by changing only the lighting latent variable in our model. By transferring learned knowledge from similar objects, albedo and surface normals estimation from a single image is possible in our model. Experiments demonstrate that our model is able to generalize as well as improve over standard baselines in one-shot face recognition.},

The problem is formulated in a$\backslash$nmanner that subsumes structure from motion, multiview stereo, and$\backslash$nphotometric stereo as special cases. The algorithm utilizes both$\backslash$nspatial and temporal intensity variation as cues: the former constrains$\backslash$nflow and the latter constrains surface orientation; combining both$\backslash$ncues enables dense reconstruction of both textured and textureless$\backslash$nsurfaces. The algorithm works by iteratively estimating affine camera$\backslash$nparameters, illumination, shape, and albedo in an alternating fashion.$\backslash$nResults are demonstrated on videos of hand-held objects moving in$\backslash$nfront of a fixed light and camera.},

abstract = {We consider the rendering of diffuse objects under distant illumination, as specified by an environment map. Using an analytic expression for the irradiance in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients of the lighting, we show that one needs to compute and use only 9 coefficients, corresponding to the lowest-frequency modes of the illumination, in order to achieve average errors of only 1{\%}. In other words, the irradiance is insensitive to high frequencies in the lighting, and is well approximated using only 9 parameters. In fact, we show that the irradiance can be procedurally represented simply as a quadratic polynomial in the cartesian components of the surface normal, and give explicit formulae. These observations lead to a simple and efficient procedural rendering algorithm amenable to hardware implementation, a prefiltering method up to three orders of magnitude faster than previous techniques, and new representations for lighting design and image-based rendering.},

@article{Xiong2013,
abstract = {We develop a framework for extracting a concise representation of the shape information available from diffuse shading in a small image patch. This produces a new mid-level scene descriptor, comprised of explicit local shape distributions that are inferred separately at every image patch across multiple scales. Our framework is based on a quadratic representation of local shape that, in the absence of noise, has guarantees on recovering accurate local shape and lighting. And when noise is present, the inferred local shape distributions provide rich shape information without over-committing to any particular image explanation. These local shape distributions enable efficient and robust reconstruction of scene lighting and object-scale shape, by naturally encoding the fact that some smooth diffuse regions are more informative than others. The experimental results show the proposed shape reconstruction algorithm compares well against the state-of-art counterparts on both synthetic and real image data sets.},

@article{Tan2008,
abstract = {Conventional photometric stereo recovers one normal direction per pixel of the input image. This fundamentally limits the scale of recovered geometry to the resolution of the input image, and cannot model surfaces with subpixel geometric structures. In this paper, we propose a method to recover subpixel surface geometry by studying the relationship between the subpixel geometry and the reflectance properties of a surface. We first describe a generalized physically-based reflectance model that relates the distribution of surface normals inside each pixel area to its reflectance function. The distribution of surface normals can be computed from the reflectance functions recorded in photometric stereo images. A convexity measure of subpixel geometry structure is also recovered at each pixel, through an analysis of the shadowing attenuation. Then, we use the recovered distribution of surface normals and the surface convexity to infer subpixel geometric structures on a surface of homogeneous material by spatially arranging the normals among pixels at a higher resolution than that of the input image. Finally, we optimize the arrangement of normals using a combination of belief propagation and MCMC based on a minimum description length criterion on 3D textons over the surface. The experiments demonstrate the validity of our approach and show superior geometric resolution for the recovered surfaces.},

abstract = {We present fast methods for separating the direct and global illumi- nation components of a scene measured by a camera and illuminated by a light source. In theory, the separation can be done with just two images taken with a high frequency binary illumination pattern and its complement. In practice, a larger number of images are used to overcome the optical and resolution limitations of the camera and the source. The approach does not require the material properties of ob- jects and media in the scene to be known. However, we require that the illumination frequency is high enough to adequately sample the global components received by scene points. We present separation results for scenes that include complex interreflections, subsurface scattering and volumetric scattering. Several variants of the sepa- ration approach are also described. When a sinusoidal illumination pattern is used with different phase shifts, the separation can be done using just three images. When the computed images are of lower resolution than the source and the camera, smoothness constraints are used to perform the separation using a single image. Finally, in the case of a static scene that is lit by a simple point source, such as the sun, a moving occluder and a video camera can be used to do the separation. We also show several simple examples of how novel images of a scene can be computed from the separation results. CR},

For surfaces with varying material properties, a full segmentation into different material types is also computed. It is assumed that the camera viewpoint is fixed, but the illumination varies over the input sequence. It is also assumed that one or more example objects with similar materials and known geometry are imaged under the same illumination conditions. Unlike most previous work in shape reconstruction, this technique can handle objects with arbitrary and spatially-varying BRDFs. Furthermore, the approach works for arbitrary distant and unknown lighting environments. Finally, almost no calibration is needed, making the approach exceptionally simple to apply.},

In this paper, we present an efficient desirability-aware load balancing algorithm to tackle the above new challenges in heterogeneous grid systems. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm yields better performance when compared with the so-called "Nearest Neighbor" load balancing (LB) algorithm.

abstract = {Neurobehavioural analysis of mouse phenotypes requires the monitoring of mouse behaviour over long periods of time. In this study, we describe a trainable computer vision system enabling the automated analysis of complex mouse behaviours. We provide software and an extensive manually annotated video database used for training and testing the system. Our system performs on par with human scoring, as measured from ground-truth manual annotations of thousands of clips of freely behaving mice. As a validation of the system, we characterized the home-cage behaviours of two standard inbred and two non-standard mouse strains. From these data, we were able to predict in a blind test the strain identity of individual animals with high accuracy. Our video-based software will complement existing sensor-based automated approaches and enable an adaptable, comprehensive, high-throughput, fine-grained, automated analysis of mouse behaviour.},

abstract = {We describe a new formulation of appearance-only SLAM suitable for very large scale place recognition. The system navigates in the space of appearance, assigning each new observation to either a new or a previously visited location, without reference to metric position. The system is demonstrated performing reliable online appearance mapping and loop-closure detection over a 1000 km trajectory, with mean filter update times of 14 ms. The scalability of the system is achieved by defining a sparse approximation to the FAB-MAP model suitable for implementation using an inverted index. Our formulation of the problem is fully probabilistic and naturally incorporates robustness against perceptual aliasing. We also demonstrate that the approach substantially outperforms the standard term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (tf-idf) ranking measure. The 1000 km data set comprising almost a terabyte of omni-directional and stereo imagery is available for use, and we hope that it will serve as a benchmark for future systems.},

abstract = {This paper describes a probabilistic approach to the problem of recognizing places based on their appearance. The system we present is not limited to localization, but can determine that a new observation comes from a previously unseen place, and so augment its map. Effectively this is a SLAM system in the space of appearance. Our probabilistic approach allows us to explicitly account for perceptual aliasing in the environment--identical but indistinctive observations receive a low probability of having come from the same place. We achieve this by learning a generative model of place appearance. By partitioning the learning problem into two parts, new place models can be learned online from only a single observation of a place. The algorithm complexity is linear in the number of places in the map, and is particularly suitable for online loop closure detection in mobile robotics.},

In this work, we apply a deep learning approach to solve this problem, which avoids time-consuming hand-design of features. This presents two main challenges. First, we need to evaluate a huge number of candidate grasps. In order to make detection fast, as well as robust, we present a two-step cascaded structure with two deep networks, where the top detections from the first are re-evaluated by the second. The first network has fewer features, is faster to run, and can effectively prune out unlikely candidate grasps. The second, with more features, is slower but has to run only on the top few detections. Second, we need to handle multimodal inputs well, for which we present a method to apply structured regularization on the weights based on multimodal group regularization. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in robotic grasp detection, and can be used to successfully execute grasps on two different robotic platforms.},

@article{Ren2013a,
abstract = {We present radiance regression functions for fast rendering of global illumination in scenes with dynamic local light sources. A radiance regression function (RRF) represents a non-linear map- ping from local and contextual attributes of surface points, such as position, viewing direction, and lighting condition, to their indirect illumination values. The RRF is obtained from precomputed shad- ing samples through regression analysis, which determines a func- tion that best fits the shading data. For a given scene, the shading samples are precomputed by an offline renderer. The key idea behind our approach is to exploit the nonlinear co- herence of the indirect illumination data to make the RRF both compact and fast to evaluate. We model the RRF as a multilayer acyclic feed-forward neural network, which provides a close func- tional approximation of the indirect illumination and can be effi- ciently evaluated at run time. To effectively model scenes with spa- tially variant material properties, we utilize an augmented set of attributes as input to the neural network RRF to reduce the amount of inference that the network needs to perform. To handle scenes with greater geometric complexity, we partition the input space of the RRF model and represent the subspaces with separate, smaller RRFs that can be evaluated more rapidly. As a result, the RRF model scales well to increasingly complex scene geometry and ma- terial variation. Because of its compactness and ease of evaluation, the RRF model enables real-time rendering with full global illu- mination effects, including changing caustics and multiple-bounce high-frequency glossy interreflections},
